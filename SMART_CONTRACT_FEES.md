## Fee Breakdown Analysis

### What Actually Happens On-Chain

#### 1. **Market Creation**
- **Stake Required**: 1.0 BNB (exact amount)
- **Refund**: Creator receives 1.0 BNB back + 0.5% creator fee after resolution
- **Location**: `PredictionMarket.sol` lines 80, 101, 157-162

```solidity
uint256 public createMarketStake = 1.0 ether;  // Line 30

function createMarket(...) external payable {
    require(msg.value == createMarketStake, "Must send exact stake amount");
    // ... market creation logic ...
    creatorStake: msg.value  // Stored for refund
}
```

#### 2. **Placing Bets**
- **Smart Contract Behavior**: Full bet amount (100%) goes directly to betting pools
- **No on-chain fee deduction**: Contract does NOT collect any platform fee during `placeBet()`
- **Location**: `PredictionMarket.sol` lines 108-143

```solidity
function placeBet(uint256 marketId, bool prediction) external payable {
    require(msg.value >= minBetAmount, "Bet amount too low");
    
    if (prediction) {
        market.yesPool += msg.value;  // Full amount to pool
    } else {
        market.noPool += msg.value;   // Full amount to pool
    }
    
    market.totalPool += msg.value;    // No fee deduction
}
```

**Key Finding**: Contract collects **0% platform fee** during betting phase.

#### 3. **Market Resolution**
- **Creator Fee**: 0.5% of total pool (5 basis points)
- **Calculation**: `(totalPool * 5) / 1000 = 0.5%`
- **Payment**: Goes to market creator alongside stake refund
- **Location**: `PredictionMarket.sol` lines 145-168

```solidity
function resolveMarket(uint256 marketId, bool outcome) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 creatorFee = (market.totalPool * 5) / 1000;  // 0.5%
    uint256 totalPayout = market.creatorStake + creatorFee;
    
    // Send stake refund + 0.5% creator fee
    (bool success, ) = payable(market.creator).call{value: totalPayout}("");
}
```

#### 4. **Claiming Winnings**
- **Payout Calculation**: Based on `availablePool = totalPool - creatorFee`
- **Winners Split**: 99.5% of total pool (after 0.5% creator fee)
- **Location**: `PredictionMarket.sol` lines 170-209

```solidity
function claimWinnings(uint256 marketId) external {
    uint256 creatorFee = (market.totalPool * 5) / 1000;  // 0.5%
    uint256 availablePool = market.totalPool - creatorFee;  // 99.5%
    
    // Winners proportionally split the availablePool (99.5%)
    winnings = (userBet.amount * availablePool) / winningPool;
}
```

## Frontend Configuration (Off-Chain)

**Location**: `client/src/lib/contractConfig.ts` lines 55-64

```typescript
export const TAX_CONFIG = {
  TAX_RATE_PERCENT: 1,        // 1% platform tax
  TAX_RATE_DECIMAL: 0.01,
  BET_POOL_PERCENT: 99,       // 99% to pool
  BET_POOL_DECIMAL: 0.99,
}

export const ESCROW_WALLET_ADDRESS = '0xC196dc762FbC2AB044AAEAc05E27CD10c4982a01'
```

**Current Implementation**: 
- Frontend splits user's bet into two transactions:
  1. **1% to escrow wallet** (`ESCROW_WALLET_ADDRESS`)
  2. **99% to contract** (goes to betting pool)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISCREPANCY

### Smart Contract Reality
- **Betting Phase**: 0% platform fee (100% to pools)
- **Resolution Phase**: 0.5% creator fee (paid to market creator)
- **Winner Payouts**: From 99.5% of total pool

### Frontend Claims
- **Betting Phase**: 1% platform tax to escrow wallet
- **Pool Allocation**: 99% to betting pool
- **Marketing**: "0.5% vs 2%" fees for BNBALL holders (Tokenomics page)

### Actual Fee Structure
| Phase | Fee | Recipient | Implementation |
|-------|-----|-----------|----------------|
| Bet Placement | 1% | Escrow Wallet | Off-chain (frontend enforced) |
| Bet Placement | 99% | Contract Pools | On-chain |
| Resolution | 0.5% | Market Creator | On-chain |
| Winnings | 99.5% | Winners | On-chain |

**Total Platform Revenue**: 
- Off-chain: 1% of all bets (sent to escrow)
- On-chain: 0% (contract doesn't collect platform fees)

---

## Options to Resolve Discrepancy

### Option 1: Update Frontend to Match Contract (Recommended)
**Action**: Remove 1% platform tax from frontend, reflect actual 0.5% creator fee

**Changes Required**:
```typescript
// client/src/lib/contractConfig.ts
export const TAX_CONFIG = {
  TAX_RATE_PERCENT: 0,         // No platform tax
  TAX_RATE_DECIMAL: 0.0,
  BET_POOL_PERCENT: 100,       // 100% to pool
  BET_POOL_DECIMAL: 1.0,
}
```

**Pros**:
- Honest representation of on-chain behavior
- No multi-transaction complexity
- Lower user friction (single transaction)

**Cons**:
- Platform loses 1% revenue stream
- Escrow wallet becomes unused

---

### Option 2: Continue Off-Chain Fee Collection (Current State)
**Action**: Keep frontend as-is, document that 1% is off-chain fee

**Changes Required**:
- Update documentation to clarify off-chain vs on-chain fees
- Ensure all UI mentions "platform fee" not "contract fee"

**Pros**:
- Platform keeps 1% revenue
- No code changes needed

**Cons**:
- Users must approve two transactions per bet
- More complex UX (gas costs, failed transactions)
- Not enforced by contract (users could bypass frontend)

---

### Option 3: Redeploy Contract with Platform Fee (Nuclear Option)
**Action**: Modify contract to collect 1% platform fee on-chain during `placeBet()`

**Changes Required**:
```solidity
function placeBet(uint256 marketId, bool prediction) external payable {
    uint256 platformFee = (msg.value * 10) / 1000;  // 1%
    uint256 betAmount = msg.value - platformFee;
    
    // Send platform fee to owner/treasury
    payable(owner).transfer(platformFee);
    
    // Add betAmount to pools
    if (prediction) {
        market.yesPool += betAmount;
    } else {
        market.noPool += betAmount;
    }
}
```

**Pros**:
- Single-source-of-truth for fees
- Contract enforces fee (cannot be bypassed)
- Simpler frontend (one transaction)

**Cons**:
- **Requires full redeployment** to new address
- All existing markets on old contract become orphaned
- Users must migrate to new contract
- Re-audit and testing required
- Update WalletConnect config, frontend, docs

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Choose Option 1 or 2** based on business requirements
2. If keeping off-chain fees (Option 2):
   - Verify escrow wallet is secure multi-sig
   - Monitor escrow balance matches expected 1% of volume
   - Update UI to clearly show "Off-chain platform fee: 1%"

3. If removing off-chain fees (Option 1):
   - Update `TAX_CONFIG` to 0%
   - Remove escrow wallet transaction logic
   - Update all UI to reflect "Creator fee: 0.5%" only
   - Update Tokenomics/FAQ pages

### Long-Term Considerations
- **Option 3 (redeployment)** should only be done if:
  - Platform has minimal usage (easy migration)
  - Business requires on-chain fee enforcement
  - Budget allows for full audit + deployment costs

---

## Testing Requirements

Regardless of chosen option, validate:

1. **End-to-End Betting Flow**:
   - Connect wallet
   - Place bet on live market
   - Verify transaction(s) complete
   - Check balance deduction matches expectations
   - Verify bet appears in profile history

2. **Fee Collection**:
   - Track escrow wallet balance before/after bets
   - Verify 1% of bet amounts reach escrow (if Option 2)
   - Verify 0% goes to escrow (if Option 1)

3. **Market Resolution**:
   - Resolve market with owner account
   - Verify creator receives stake + 0.5% creator fee
   - Verify winners can claim from 99.5% pool

4. **Winner Payout Calculation**:
   ```
   Example: 10 BNB total pool, 7 BNB on YES, 3 BNB on NO, outcome = YES
   
   Creator fee = 10 * 0.005 = 0.05 BNB
   Available pool = 10 - 0.05 = 9.95 BNB
   
   User bet 1 BNB on YES:
   Winnings = (1 * 9.95) / 7 = 1.421 BNB
   Profit = 1.421 - 1 = 0.421 BNB (42.1% return)
   ```

## Current Production Status (Updated 2025-10-29)

- **Mainnet Contract**: Deployed at `0xc771cB065CF393a9Bde512714dCBD20C69Af59Ac`
- **Frontend Config**: ‚úÖ Now collects 8% off-chain to escrow wallet
- **User Experience**: Two transactions per bet (8% to escrow + 92% to contract)
- **Actual On-Chain Fee**: 0.5% creator fee only
- **UI Display**: Fees are now HIDDEN from users (automatic deduction without breakdown)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW REQUIREMENT: 10% Total Fees (8% Platform + 2% Creator)

**User Request**: Achieve 10% total fee split:
- 8% platform fee ‚Üí Escrow wallet (off-chain) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- 2% creator fee ‚Üí Market creator (on-chain) ‚ùå **BLOCKED BY CONTRACT**

**Current Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ 8% platform fee collected off-chain before betting
- ‚ùå 0.5% creator fee enforced on-chain (contract hardcoded)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Gap: Need 1.5% more creator fee (2% - 0.5% = 1.5%)

**Decision Required**: User/owner must choose Option 1, 2, or 3 above, OR accept current 8.5% total fees (8% platform + 0.5% creator).
